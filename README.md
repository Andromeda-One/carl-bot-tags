# [Carl Tags](https://docs.carl.gg/tags-and-triggers/tags-advanced-usage/ "All the info you could possibly need!")
A collection of Carl-Bot tags I have made this year.
Some of these tags are NOT mine, credit is given where applicable! Please do not remove the credits and respect the creators!
I'm still learning so please do suggest stuff and flag any issues!

Big thanks to those at Carl-Bot Support for helping me figure out where my brain did a dumb!
This language applies only to this one bot on Discord (just an FYI).
